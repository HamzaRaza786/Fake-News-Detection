# Fake-News-Detection
Fake news has been one of the most divisive topics over the last 5 years. In simple
terms, Fake News is providing misleading or false information as ‘real’ or ‘factual’ news.
The term came to prominence during the 2016 US Presidential Elections, when bogus
sites and news articles considerably changed the voters’ opinion against Democratic
candidate Hillary Clinton in favor of Republican candidate Donald Trump. The
incumbent US president’s election victory is sometimes attributed to false online
propaganda initiated against his opponents, which was mostly in the form of fake news.
